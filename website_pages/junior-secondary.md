# Welcome to the Junior Secondary School

Tuhia ki te rangi
Tuhia ki te whenua
T-hia ki te ngakau o nga tangata
Ko te mea nui
Ko te aroha
Tihei Mauri Ora!Ko te wehi ki te Atua
Me whakakororia tona ingoa
I nga wa katoa
Nau te rourou, Naku te rourou
Ka ora ai te iwi

Tena koutou, Tena koutou, Tena koutou katoa

Write it in the sky
Write it in the land
Write it in the heart of the people
The greatest thing is love
Behold there is Life!Regards to the Creator
Glorify his name
For all times
with your basket and my basket the people will be fed

Welcome, welcome, welcome all

## About the Department

Our Junior Secondary School teaching team is dedicated to providing a high quality learning environment with a focus on equipping and transforming Year 7 to 10 students as they transition between Primary School and Secondary School. We design quality learning experiences to equip students with the skills, knowledge, and understanding to achieve their best. We use a discipleship process that focuses on transforming students as they grow a sense of Value, Identity, and Purpose as a child of God, and drawing on His Strength. We call this our “VIPS”. With God’s help, we build young people who understand they are on a journey, learn about others, and themselves, and seek to fulfil God’s greatest commandment - to love God, and love others as themselves.

A foundational verse for us is: “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” Matthew 28:19-20

Tuhia is a powerful song about God’s Love that is the most powerful Love and that we should always strive to Love like God does - ourselves and anyone else.

## Year 9 Intake Transition
