Activity Costs
There are a number of activities that students participate in that enhance students learning. For some of these activities we ask parents to contribute to the costs. Where parents are unable to contribute, we have either a free alternative or will cover the costs through the school. These payments are received as a donation and a donation receipt will be issued to the payee.

Payment method/s: Online Banking, EFTPOS, Credit Card, cash or cheque.

Activity costs are generally determined prior to the beginning of a new term.

Special Character Donation
As an integrated school, the Ministry of Education allows us to integrate our special character through all aspects of our school’s operation and curriculum. However, all aspects of this, including resources and professional development, are not funded by the Crown. We therefore ask parents for a tax-deductible donation of $215 per student ($54 per student per term or part thereof).

This donation is payable to Hamilton Christian School Incorporated
