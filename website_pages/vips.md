# VIPS

Our desire is that all our students will find completeness and fulfilment in their lives because of their time at HCS. While we desire that they will all know Christ personally, we know that this ultimately is the role of the Holy Spirit. We believe our students will develop resilience and confidence that God has a plan for each of them through an appreciation of our VIPS.

Value: Through intentional planning and actions, students will understand that all of us have VALUE as we are created in the image of God and in line with the scriptures, we are all sons and daughters of the most High.

Identity: Through intentional planning and actions, students will understand that while we are created in the image of God, we are unique, and we can find complete identity through Christ in our lives.

Purpose: Through intentional planning and actions, students will understand that God has a purpose for us on this earth. Our purpose can firstly be found in loving God, loving our neighbour and loving ourselves, and also in going into all the world and making disciples of all nations. While these are common callings for all people, God will also have a purpose that is unique for us and based on God's gifting in our lives, we will find completeness.

Strength: Through intentional planning and actions, students will understand that as we pursue our purpose, we will be able to achieve immeasurably more than we can dream or imagine if we do so in His strength and not just our own.
