# Transitioning away from Year 9 Intake.  
<br/>
After much reflection, the decision has been made to begin a transition away from having a formal entry point into HCS at Y9.  I appreciate that for some families this news will be met with great disappointment as their preference would be to transition at Year 9.  However, we have to make some changes due to the increasing difficulties of integrating significant numbers of students into the school at Year 9.  
<br/>
**Due to this change, if you would like to enrol your child into our senior high school and they are in Y6 this year (2025), the greatest chance for enrolment acceptance, will be to enrol for Y7 for 2026.**
<br/>
## There will be a two-year transition
<br/>
During 2026 and 2027, we will increase the number of Y7 and Y9 students by at least one class. However, as of 2028, there will only be an increase of classes in Y7.
<br/>
## Why the change?
<br/>
Having entry points at Y7 and Y9 is a complex issue.  Whenever we have a significant increase of students in any year group there is an unsettling and a resettling of culture, friend groups, and ‘pecking order’ as new students settle into pre-existing friend groups.
<br/>
Currently, a solid friend group can be established through primary school, and then when our students get to Y7, 30 or more new students are introduced into the existing groups and culture.  Those new students need to settle into pre-existing friendship groups, and we are finding that this takes time, sometimes six months, even a year or more.
<br/>
Students then have a somewhat more settled year in Y8 before we introduce another large group of students in Y9.  At this point the cycle repeats, and it takes another period of time to reestablish friend groups and culture.  Furthermore, the older the students are, the longer and more dramatic the impact of integrating new students.  We are finding that it is taking until the students are in Y11 for this to settle.
<br/>
We realise that this will put more pressure on the Y7 group to establish culture and friend groups, but with this unsettling isolated to just one group, we can intentionally target this space with resources, time, activities, and other intentional actions, thus ensuring the transition of new students is as smooth as possible.
<br/>
Academically, we also have data that continually points to the fact that the longer that students are at HCS, the stronger they achieve academically.  Now that Y10 has the national Common Achievement Assessments (CAAs), we have a greater chance of finding success with Y10 cohorts if we get to start working with them from Y7 or earlier.
<br/>
## Some opportunities to enter at Y9
<br/>
While we will not have an official entry point at Y9, we do find that at the end of each year there are openings within year groups. Therefore, there are always a handful of enrolment opportunities.
<br/>
Official entry points to HCS in the future (Y1, Y7)
<br/>
Naturally, we will always have an entry point at Year 0/1,  and this change will not compromise that.  We will also continue to have an entry official entry point at Year 7.
<br/>
## Final word
<br/>
Please note that we are very aware that there are some schools that feed into our school which go through to Y8, and therefore a transition at the Y9 stage is desirable.  As mentioned, while we understand this desire, our responsibility to our community is to set the school up in a way that best promotes success, both culturally and academically.
