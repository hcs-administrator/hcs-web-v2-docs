# From the Team Leader

Hamilton Christian School caters for approximately 180 students across the Primary School, which consists of three learning levels / groups.

The learning hub for our Year 5 and 6 students is named The Harbour -  a safe meeting place for our students from all different backgrounds to meet together.

I am blessed to lead a team of fun, motivated and passionate teachers who take pride in engaging our students in a relevant and purposeful curriculum.

Our key goals in this hub are:

- for every student to develop a personal relationship with God.

- to strengthen students' academic knowledge and skills to better prepare them for middle school.

- to provide every student with a range of extra-curricular activities to develop their ability to work as a team and most importantly make friends!

It is our heart's desire for our students to grow closer to Jesus in all that we do during our day. We teach - looking for opportunities to show students the gospel in every subject and topic!

A key scripture that embodies who we are as the Harbour,

 

Psalm 107:28-31:

"Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble,
and he brought them out of their distress.
He stilled the storm to a whisper;
the waves of the sea were hushed.
They were glad when it grew calm,
and he guided them to their desired haven.
Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love
and his wonderful deeds for mankind."
 

We pray that The Harbour would be the 'desired haven' spoken about in these verses.

Blessings,

Wesley Hedder
