# Principal's Welcome

## Tēnā koutou

Welcome to the Hamilton Christian School community,  

One of the things that Hamilton Christian School is often referred to as ‘a small school but a big family’ and that is so true.  

Like much of New Zealand, Hamilton Christian School is blessed with the diversity of cultures who call this school home. As a Christian School, it is crucial that all members of our community feel welcome and that they contribute to who we are. We strive to not only be a provider of excellent educational experiences but to do so in a way that is completely embedded in our special character—recognising, importantly that we are a Christian School within Aotearoa.  

We have five principal hopes for our students; that they would be equipped to their full potential, that they would know that we are made in the image of God and therefore have value. That we are all created and designed uniquely and ultimately can find our identity in who we are in Christ. That in understanding our purpose and seeking to fulfil it, we find wholeness. And lastly, that our students will achieve immeasurably more in their life if they live it through the strength that they find in the Lord.  

I encourage you to contact the school should you require further information regarding enrolment into the school.  

God is good,  

Shaun Brooker
Principal
