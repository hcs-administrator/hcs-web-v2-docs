# The Board of Trustees

As an integrated school, Hamilton Christian School has two boards. The School Board governs the school, and every member is equally accountable for every board action and decision.

Governance of a school includes things such as:

* Setting the strategic direction and targets for the school/kura
* Planning towards and reporting on achieving those targets
* Curriculum management
* Financial and property management
* Policies and procedures
* Health and safety
* Employment of staff at the school/kura

Boards also have to prepare and maintain the strategic goals that sets out their accountabilities to the government and their community and includes their annual targets and goals for the next three to five years.

The Board employs the school’s principal to oversee the day-to-day management of the school, and the principal follows the direction of the board to ensure the school’s goals are met.

The Board can be contacted by emailing boardoftrustees@hamiltonchristian.school.nz
