# Four Schools in One

Hamilton Christian School is a large co-educational Christian School that became integrated at the start of 2020.  Over the coming years we anticipate that we will experience extraordinary growth, however, we will continue to be intentional in making sure that every student and family feel part of the community.

We have one Principal, Mr Shaun Brooker, who oversees all aspects of the school, and each of the other areas of the school has a Team Leader who oversees the teaching, learning and pastoral care of students within their area.

The four schools are:
* Primary School, consisting of:
* * The Beehive:  Years 0-2, approximately 130 students
* * The Construction Zone: Years 3-4, approximately 100 students
* * The Harbour: Year 5-6, approximately 110 students

* Junior Secondary School, Year 7 – 10 with approximately 310 students

* Secondary School: Years 11 – 13 with approximately 130 students

* International Department: with approximately 17 students in Years 1 - 13

Please note that these numbers are based on 2023 numbers, we anticipate growth in each area of the school as per our Integration Agreement.
