**HCS Association**

Hamilton Christian School is owned and operated by Hamilton Christian Schools Incorporated (the Association), through an elected Board of Proprietors. The Association is committed, by its Constitution, to an education which is Christ centered so as to help enable children enrolled at its school to know and love the Lord in all spheres of life.

Membership of the Association is open to all people who are genuinely interested in and want to help and support the school. Should you wish to become a member, please contact the proprietor for an application form and more information. Membership of the Association is available to people who, in good conscience, agree with the Association’s ‘Statement of Faith,’ sign the form to that effect, and pay the modest Annual Membership Fee. Benefits of Association membership include an opportunity to participate in Association activities, the right to vote at Association meetings and an opportunity to be elected on to the Association’s Board of Proprietors.
