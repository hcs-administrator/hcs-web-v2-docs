# Statement of Faith

The unity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit in the Godhead.

The Sovereignty of God in creation, revelation, redemption and final judgement.

The divine inspiration and trustworthiness of Holy Scripture, as originally given and its supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct.

The universal sinfulness and guilt of human nature since, the fall, rendering humankind subject to Godâ€™s wrath and condemnation.

Redemption from the guilt, penalty, pollution and power of sin only through the sacrificial death (as our representative and substitute) of Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son of God and received by the grace of God through faith alone.

The bodily resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.

The necessity of the work of the Holy Spirit to make the death of Christ effective to the individual sinner, granting repentance toward God and faith in Jesus Christ.

The indwelling and sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit in the believer.

The only holy, universal church, which is the Body of Christ, to which all true believers belong and in which they are united through the Spirit.

The Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, His bodily resurrection, His ascension to the right hand of the Father, His present mediatorial work and His personal return in power and glory.
