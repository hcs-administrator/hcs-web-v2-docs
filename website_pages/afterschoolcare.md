# After School Care

Hamilton Christian School After School Care Program 2024

Hamilton Christian School is proud to offer an After-School Care program every day after school for HCS students in Years 1-10 from 3:10 until 5:45 pm.

Children can be booked in as a permanent booking, a casual booking, or in emergency instances. 

Each day starts with afternoon tea and some free play, including doing puzzles, playing board games, or spending time with Lego.

If the weather permits, we play outside; if not, we start on an indoor craft activity. We aim to have an activity that ties in with our chosen theme and theme our colouring and activity pages for our afternoon. Finally, we finish with free play, and if children want to, a time to do homework. (Please let us know if you would like your child to do homework at this time regularly)

Costs:  

Regular/permanent bookings:

3:15 – 5:00 pm: $15
3:15 – 5:45 pm: $20
Casual bookings (made with at least 24 hours notice)

3:15 - 5:45 pm - $20
These bookings will need to be made 24 hours in advance so that we can arrange the correct staffing numbers, and they will be charged at the casual rate of $20 with pick up by 5:45 pm.

Emergency booking

 3:15 - 5:45 pm - $25
We understand that things happen, and occasionally, you must book your child into after-school care. For these emergencies on the day bookings, we charge $25

With all our bookings, late fees will be charged at $10 per child per 10 minutes or part thereof if a parent or caregiver is late from the agreed pick-up time. Abuse of this timeframe will void their future attendance.
